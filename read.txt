Randomization On:
the scanf function in vul_prog.c reads in an int and a string.
this int, stored in the variable int_input, is what we use to hold the address of our second secret number to be overwritten. It is the decimal
representation of the hex address of our second secret number. The address randomization wasn't an issue because the stack pointer still had the same
distance to travel within the frame holding the secret number variables.
 
Example Input to vul_prog.c:
134524940
%x,%x,%x,%x,%x,%x,%x,%n,%n


Randomization Off:
Example Input to write_string.c which adds the address of our second secret 
number to the front of the file mystring which is directed into vul_prog.c 
at runtime:
%x,%x,%x,%x,%x,%x,%x,%n,%x,%n
